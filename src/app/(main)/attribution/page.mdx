# Attribution

I make this website (From scratch BTW) for improving my coding skills and practicing my English. Also for expressing myself.

Thanks to all of this incredible things (in alphabetical order) that make my website happen. I built this site in early 2025 and I'm promising this is my last personal website I ever built. May be I'm gonna fix it or improve it anytime if it seems off.

My website source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/fadhilkholaf/tulungagung). Let me know if there is a bug or something else that I can improve. Always open for sugestions.
